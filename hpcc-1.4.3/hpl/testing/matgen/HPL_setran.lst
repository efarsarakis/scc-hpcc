   75.      * HPL_setran initializes  the random generator with the encoding of the
   76.      * first number X(0) in the sequence,  and the constants a and c used to
   77.      * compute the next element in the sequence: X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c.  X(0),
   78.      * a and c are stored in the static variables  irand, ias and ics.  When
   79.      * OPTION is 0 (resp. 1 and 2),  irand  (resp. ia and ic)  is set to the
   80.      * values of the input array IRAN.  When OPTION is 3, IRAN is set to the
   81.      * current value of irand, and irand is then incremented.
