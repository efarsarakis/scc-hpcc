   73.      * HPL_jumpit jumps in the random sequence from the number  X(n) encoded
   74.      * in IRANN to the number  X(m)  encoded in  IRANM using the constants A
   75.      * and C encoded in MULT and IADD: X(m) = A * X(n) + C.  The constants A
   76.      * and C obviously depend on m and n,  see  the function  HPL_xjumpm  in
   77.      * order to initialize them.

   83.      *         On entry, MULT is an array of dimension 2, that contains the

   85.      *
   86.      * IADD    (local input)                 int *
   87.      *         On entry, IADD is an array of dimension 2, that contains the
   88.      *         16-lower and 15-higher bits of the constant C.
   89.      *
   90.      * IRANN   (local input)                 int *
   91.      *         On entry,  IRANN  is an array of dimension 2,  that contains 
   92.      *         the 16-lower and 15-higher bits of the encoding of X(n).

   94.      * IRANM   (local output)                int *
