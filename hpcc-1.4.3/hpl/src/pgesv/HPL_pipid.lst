   69.            * =======
   70.            *
   71.            * HPL_pipid computes an array  IPID  that contains the source and final
   72.            * destination  of  matrix rows  resulting  from  the  application  of N
   73.            * interchanges  as computed by the  LU  factorization  with row partial
   74.            * pivoting. The array IPID is such that the row of global index IPID(i)
   75.            * should be mapped onto the row of global index IPID(i+1). Note that we
   76.            * cannot really know the length of IPID a priori. However, we know that
   77.            * this array is at least 2*N long,  since  there are N rows to swap and
   78.            * broadcast. The length of this array  must be smaller than or equal to
   79.            * 4*N, since every row is swapped with at most a single distinct remote
   80.            * row. The algorithm constructing  IPID  goes as follows: Let IA be the
   81.            * global index of the first row to be swapped.
   82.            *  
   83.            * For every row src IA + i with i in [0..N) to be swapped with row  dst
   84.            * such that dst is given by DPIV[i]:
   85.            *  
   86.            * Is row  src  the destination  of a previous row of the current block,
   87.            * that is, is there k odd such that IPID(k) is equal to src ?
   88.            *     Yes:  update  this destination  with dst.  For  example,  if  the
   89.            * pivot array is  (0,2)(1,1)(2,5) ... , then when we swap rows 2 and 5,
   90.            * we swap in fact row 0 and 5,  i.e.,  row 0 goes to 5 and not 2  as it
   91.            * was thought so far ...
   92.            *     No :  add  the pair (src,dst) at the end of IPID; row src has not
   93.            * been moved yet.
   94.            *  
   95.            * Is row  dst  different  from src the destination of a previous row of
   96.            * the current block, i.e., is there k odd such that IPID(k) is equal to
   97.            * dst ?
   98.            *     Yes:  update  IPID(k) with src.  For example,  if the pivot array
   99.            * is (0,5)(1,1)(2,5) ... , then when  we swap rows  2 and 5, we swap in
  100.            * fact row 2 and 0,  i.e.,  row 0 goes to 2 and not 5 as it was thought
  101.            * so far ...
  102.            *     No : add  the  pair (dst,src) at the end of IPID; row dst has not
  103.            * been moved yet.
  104.            *  
  105.            * Note that when src is equal to dst, the pair (dst,src)  should not be
  106.            * added to  IPID  in  order  to avoid duplicated entries in this array.
  107.            * During  the construction of the array  IPID,  we  make  sure that the
  108.            * first N entries are such that IPID(k) with k odd is equal to  IA+k/2.
  109.            * For k in  [0..K/2),  the  row  of global index  IPID(2*k)  should  be
  110.            * mapped onto the row of global index IPID(2*k+1).
