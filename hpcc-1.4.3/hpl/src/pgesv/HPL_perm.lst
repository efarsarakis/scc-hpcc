   72.             *
   73.             * HPL_perm combines  two  index  arrays  and generate the corresponding
   74.             * permutation. First, this function computes the inverse of LINDXA, and
   75.             * then combine it with LINDXAU.  Second, in order to be able to perform
   76.             * the permutation in place,  LINDXAU  is overwritten by the sequence of
   77.             * permutation  producing  the  same result.  What we ultimately want to
   78.             * achieve is:  U[LINDXAU[i]] := U[LINDXA[i]] for i in [0..N). After the
   79.             * call to this function,  this in place permutation can be performed by
   80.             * for i in [0..N) swap U[i] with U[LINDXAU[i]].
   81.             *
