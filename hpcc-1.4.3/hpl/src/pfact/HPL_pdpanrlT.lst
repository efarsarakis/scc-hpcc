   73.          * =======
   74.          *
   75.          * HPL_pdpanrlT factorizes  a panel of columns  that is a sub-array of a
   76.          * larger one-dimensional panel A using the Right-looking variant of the
   77.          * usual one-dimensional algorithm.  The lower triangular N0-by-N0 upper
   78.          * block of the panel is stored in transpose form.
   79.          *  
   80.          * Bi-directional  exchange  is  used  to  perform  the  swap::broadcast
   81.          * operations  at once  for one column in the panel.  This  results in a
   82.          * lower number of slightly larger  messages than usual.  On P processes
   83.          * and assuming bi-directional links,  the running time of this function
   84.          * can be approximated by (when N is equal to N0):
   85.          *  
   86.          *    N0 * log_2( P ) * ( lat + ( 2*N0 + 4 ) / bdwth ) +
   87.          *    N0^2 * ( M - N0/3 ) * gam2-3
   88.          *  
   89.          * where M is the local number of rows of  the panel, lat and bdwth  are
   90.          * the latency and bandwidth of the network for  double  precision  real
   91.          * words,  and  gam2-3  is an estimate of the  Level 2 and Level 3  BLAS
   92.          * rate of execution. The  recursive  algorithm  allows indeed to almost
   93.          * achieve  Level 3 BLAS  performance  in the panel factorization.  On a
   94.          * large  number of modern machines,  this  operation is however latency
   95.          * bound,  meaning  that its cost can  be estimated  by only the latency
   96.          * portion N0 * log_2(P) * lat.  Mono-directional links will double this
   97.          * communication cost.
   98.          *  
   99.          * Note that  one  iteration of the the main loop is unrolled. The local
  100.          * computation of the absolute value max of the next column is performed
  101.          * just after its update by the current column. This allows to bring the
  102.          * current column only  once through  cache at each  step.  The  current
  103.          * implementation  does not perform  any blocking  for  this sequence of
  104.          * BLAS operations, however the design allows for plugging in an optimal
  105.          * (machine-specific) specialized  BLAS-like kernel.  This idea has been
  106.          * suggested to us by Fred Gustavson, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
