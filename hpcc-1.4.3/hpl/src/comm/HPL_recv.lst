   82.      * HPL_recv is a simple wrapper around  MPI_Recv.  Its  main  purpose is
   83.      * to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
   84.      * Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code

   86.      * zero, this function returns immediately.

   95.      * RCOUNT  (local input)                 int
   96.      *         On entry,  RCOUNT  specifies  the number  of double precision
   97.      *         entries in RBUF. RCOUNT must be at least zero.
   98.      *
   99.      * SRC     (local input)                 int
  100.      *         On entry, SRC  specifies the rank of the  sending  process in
  101.      *         the communication space defined by COMM.
  102.      *
  103.      * RTAG    (local input)                 int
