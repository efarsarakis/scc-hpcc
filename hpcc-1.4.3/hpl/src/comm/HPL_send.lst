   83.      * to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
   84.      * Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code

   86.      * zero, this function returns immediately.

   98.      *
   99.      * DEST    (local input)                 int
  100.      *         On entry, DEST specifies the rank of the receiving process in
  101.      *         the communication space defined by COMM.

  103.      * STAG    (local input)                 int
