    8.                   * GUPS (Giga UPdates per Second) is a measurement that profiles the memory
    9.                   * architecture of a system and is a measure of performance similar to MFLOPS.
   10.                   * The HPCS HPCchallenge RandomAccess benchmark is intended to exercise the
   11.                   * GUPS capability of a system, much like the LINPACK benchmark is intended to
   12.                   * exercise the MFLOPS capability of a computer.  In each case, we would
   13.                   * expect these benchmarks to achieve close to the "peak" capability of the
   14.                   * memory system. The extent of the similarities between RandomAccess and
   15.                   * LINPACK are limited to both benchmarks attempting to calculate a peak system
   16.                   * capability.
   17.                   *
   18.                   * GUPS is calculated by identifying the number of memory locations that can be
   19.                   * randomly updated in one second, divided by 1 billion (1e9). The term "randomly"
   20.                   * means that there is little relationship between one address to be updated and
   21.                   * the next, except that they occur in the space of one half the total system
   22.                   * memory.  An update is a read-modify-write operation on a table of 64-bit words.
   23.                   * An address is generated, the value at that address read from memory, modified
   24.                   * by an integer operation (add, and, or, xor) with a literal value, and that
   25.                   * new value is written back to memory.
   26.                   *
   27.                   * We are interested in knowing the GUPS performance of both entire systems and
   28.                   * system subcomponents --- e.g., the GUPS rating of a distributed memory
   29.                   * multiprocessor the GUPS rating of an SMP node, and the GUPS rating of a
   30.                   * single processor.  While there is typically a scaling of FLOPS with processor
   31.                   * count, a similar phenomenon may not always occur for GUPS.
